This repository is mostly for personal use, but maybe some people might find some of the scripts useful.
It still contains a lot of drafts, non-working scripts, temporary files, etc I need to clean up.

I use it to sync my environments on the various GNU/Linux machines I have access too.

Tip:
If you need a free private git repository, have a look at assembla.com. :)

Usage:
1) Run ./bins/public_bin/setup_dotfiles.sh to set up the dotfiles and bin directory.
2) Create a ~/.bash_env_private file containing:
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/public_bin

To create a launcher requiring environment variables:
Type: Application
Command: xterm -e /bin/bash -l -c matlab
