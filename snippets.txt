You can check the parameters your system was booted up with by running cat
/proc/cmdline and see if includes your changes.

Since only the shell knows how to run shell functions, you have to run a shell to run a function. You also need to mark your function for export with export -f, otherwise the subshell won't inherit them:
export -f dosomething
find . -exec bash -c 'dosomething "$0"' {} \;

For running processes:
  ps -eo 'pid user rss:8 size:8 cmd' --sort 'rss'
will give you a nice sorted list of processes and their RSS and VSZ (SIZE) in kiB (old school kB...).

For short running commands GNU time (not the bash build-in time command) has a nice capability that's not widely known yet:
  /usr/bin/time -f "RSS: %MkiB" <command>
will tell you the maximum RSS size the <command> has had during its lifetime. That's better than top or watch ps and trying to spot the process.
#              M      Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in Kilobytes.

# show parents of a given process and their PIDs:
pstree -p -s PID

# check for any process containing NAME and give ps -aux like output:
pgrep -a -f NAME

bash brace expansion:
{x..y[..incr]}
example:
for i in {0..7}{0..7}{0..7}{0..7}; do touch ${i}; chmod ${i} ${i}; done

# How to grep (search) committed code in the git history?
# cf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928584/how-to-grep-search-committed-code-in-the-git-history

  #To search for commit content (i.e., actual lines of source, as opposed to commit messages and the like), what you need to do is:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)
  git rev-list --all | xargs git grep expression will work if you run into an "Argument list too long" error
  #This will grep through all your commit text for regexp.

  #Here are some other useful ways of searching your source:
  #Search working tree for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp>

  #Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 or regexp2:
  git grep -e <regexp1> [--or] -e <regexp2>

  #Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and regexp2, reporting file paths only:
  git grep -e <regexp1> --and -e <regexp2>

  #Search working tree for files that have lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and lines of text matching regular expression regexp2:
  git grep -l --all-match -e <regexp1> -e <regexp2>

  #Search all revisions for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)

  #Search all revisions between rev1 and rev2 for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list <rev1>..<rev2>)

grep for multiple words:
  grep -E "(STR1|STR2|STR3)" foo.txt

  sed '52!d' # method 2

Easy parallel processing with GNU parallel:
  parallel -j 8 ./process {} ::: *.svg

  That will keep 8 jobs running in parallel till all 20,000 files are processed. The {} is short-hand for the filename, and the list of filenames is given after the :::. If there are too may files for your command line, you can feed them in like this on stdin:

  find . -name "*.svg" | parallel -j 8 ./process {}

  Then you would wrap your Inkscape command in a script called process and make it executable (using chmod +x process) and make it take a single parameter - i.e. the filename.

man page tips:
--------------
-search for word in man pages: man -K WORD (-K, --global-apropos)
-find location of used man page: man -w mount (-w, --where, --path, --location)

In case of networking problems:
-------------------------------
    service network-manager --full-restart

git patching:
-------------
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9810752/git-how-to-create-a-patch-without-commit
  When other guys had already given some answer which comply with git convention, the OP's question, "create a patch without commit", can be also solved in this way:

  git diff > my_patch.txt

  Later you can apply this patch, also without a commit, by:

  git apply my_patch.txt

  But if you are just working locally, a git checkout another_branch -m is good enough to bring all your current uncommit changes to that another_branch, without even patch and apply.

### Grep for any unicode characters:
grep --color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]" main.bib
grep --color='auto' -P -n "[^\x00-\x7F]" main.bib

### Grep for specific unicode character based on UTF code:
grep --color='auto' -n $'\u2212' main.bib

### Print out unicode character based on UTF code:
echo $'\u2212'
echo $'\u16A0'
