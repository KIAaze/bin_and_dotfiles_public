You can check the parameters your system was booted up with by running cat
/proc/cmdline and see if includes your changes.

Since only the shell knows how to run shell functions, you have to run a shell to run a function. You also need to mark your function for export with export -f, otherwise the subshell won't inherit them:
export -f dosomething
find . -exec bash -c 'dosomething "$0"' {} \;

For running processes:
  ps -eo 'pid user rss:8 size:8 cmd' --sort 'rss'
will give you a nice sorted list of processes and their RSS and VSZ (SIZE) in kiB (old school kB...).

For short running commands GNU time (not the bash build-in time command) has a nice capability that's not widely known yet:
  /usr/bin/time -f "RSS: %MkiB" <command>
will tell you the maximum RSS size the <command> has had during its lifetime. That's better than top or watch ps and trying to spot the process.

# show parents of a given process and their PIDs:
pstree -p -s PID

# check for any process containing NAME and give ps -aux like output:
pgrep -a -f NAME

bash brace expansion:
{x..y[..incr]}
example:
for i in {0..7}{0..7}{0..7}{0..7}; do touch ${i}; chmod ${i} ${i}; done

# find writable suid/sgid files and print in ls -l format:

Check for files+directories in base directory of external drive via locate db:
$ locate --regex -d ~/mydrive.locate.db "/media/USER/mydrive/[^/]*$"

# How to grep (search) committed code in the git history?
# cf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928584/how-to-grep-search-committed-code-in-the-git-history

  #To search for commit content (i.e., actual lines of source, as opposed to commit messages and the like), what you need to do is:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)
  git rev-list --all | xargs git grep expression will work if you run into an "Argument list too long" error
  #This will grep through all your commit text for regexp.

  #Here are some other useful ways of searching your source:
  #Search working tree for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp>

  #Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 or regexp2:
  git grep -e <regexp1> [--or] -e <regexp2>

  #Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and regexp2, reporting file paths only:
  git grep -e <regexp1> --and -e <regexp2>

  #Search working tree for files that have lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and lines of text matching regular expression regexp2:
  git grep -l --all-match -e <regexp1> -e <regexp2>

  #Search all revisions for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)

  #Search all revisions between rev1 and rev2 for text matching regular expression regexp:
  git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list <rev1>..<rev2>)

grep for multiple words:
  grep -E "(STR1|STR2|STR3)" foo.txt
